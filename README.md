# Why Don't Use X!?!
> A collection of articles on why not to use a technology / pattern / architecture / etc. etc.

People always debate about technologies they want to use or think are cool and we try to explain to them why these technologies or architectures are not supposed to be used in all cases. Everything is built for a reason and a purpose. If we use them for everything, then it can give you problems at times. So understanding the tech and why it's beneficial instead of blindly relying on it is very important.

### Disclaimer

Just for the sake of keeping things clear, I'm not saying that these technologies are bad or should not be used, but that they have a specific use case and although they can be used in several ways, it just won't be as beneficial. So please do your research first before getting along with latest buzz word and don't trust a single individual ( not even me ). Nobody knows what they are doing. They just do the best they can think of.
